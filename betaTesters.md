# Qunten in compsci 30
worked as intended,
a little easy.

# in response:
added a hit counter so you could see how much you got hit, 
making the apparent difficulty higher.
also made the platform larger, 50 length instead of 30
# gage - one of the boys in my house (no compsci knowledge)
pretty cool, worked fine.
restart button text a little off
play area isnt clearly defined

# in response
moved the restart button where it's supposed to be
added a grey bar that the player cant move outside of, should be a bit more intuitive now
